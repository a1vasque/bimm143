 In today's class we will examine some data

## 1. Importing Candy Data
```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```
## Data Exploration 
> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

There are `r nrow(candy)` candy in this dataset
```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

There are `r sum(candy)` fruity candy types in the dataset
```{r}
sum(candy[,2])
# sum(candy$fruity) works as well
```
> How many chocolate candys are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy[, 1])
# sum(candy$chocolate) works too
```
## 2. What is your favorite candy?

>Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Snickers", ]$winpercent
```

>Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

>Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```


```{r}
library(skimr)
skim(candy)
# skimr::skim(candy) works too
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The winpercent column is scaled significantly higher than the other columns in the dataset.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

Represents if the candy contains that trait.

>Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
c <- ggplot(candy) + aes(winpercent) +geom_histogram(bins = 7) +theme_bw()
c
```

>Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

The distribution is not symmetrical.

>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

It is below 50%
```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```


>Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

-first find all chocolate candy
-find their winpercent values
- calculate the mean of these values

- then do the same for fruity candy and compare
On average, the fruit candy is ranked higher than the chocolate candy
```{r}
chocolate.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
chocolate.win <- candy[chocolate.inds, ]$winpercent
c <- mean(chocolate.win)
```

```{r}
fruity.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruity.win <- candy[fruity.inds, ]$winpercent
f <- mean(fruity.win)
```

```{r}
c > f
```

Chocolate candy is ranker higher than fruit candy, on average.
>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(chocolate.win, fruity.win)
```

Yes, the difference is statistically significant based on the low p-value.

## 3. Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

The `order()` function returns the indices that make the input sorted.
```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

>Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = T),], n=5)
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +geom_col()
```
> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +geom_col() +theme_bw()
```


```{r}
my_cols=rep("maroon", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "cadetblue"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "navy"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "royalblue"
```

```{r}
gg <- ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) + theme_bw()
gg + labs(title = "People's Favorite Candy", x = "Preference", y = "Candy") + theme(axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold", size = 17), axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold", size = 17), 
plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 20, face = "bold"))
```

```{r}
ggsave("mybarplot.png", height = 10)
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst

## 4. Taking a look at pricepercent

Plot of winpercent vs pricepercent

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label = rownames(candy)) + geom_point(col = my_cols) +
  theme_bw() +geom_text(col = my_cols)
```
There are too many labels in this above plot to be readable. We can use the `ggrepel` package to do a better job of placing labels so they minimize text overlap.

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label = rownames(candy)) + geom_point(col = my_cols) +
  theme_bw() +geom_text_repel(col = my_cols, max.overlaps = 5, size = 3.3)
```

## 5. Exploring the Correltation Structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity are anti-correlated
> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and winpercent

## 6. Principal Component Analysis

We will perform a PCA of the candy. Key-question: do we need to scale the data before PCA?

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = T)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[, 1], pca$x[,2], col = my_cols, pch = 16)
```

```{r}
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
head(my_data)
```

```{r}
ggplot(my_data) +aes(PC1, PC2, label = rownames(my_data)) + geom_point(col = my_cols)
```


```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)
p
```

```{r}
p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
p
```

```{r}
library(plotly)
```
```{r}
#ggplotly(p)
```

How do the original variables contribute to our PCs? For this we look at the loadings component of our results object i.e. the `pca$rotation` object

```{r}
head(pca$rotation)
```
Make a barplot with ggplot and order the bars by their value. Recall that you need a data.frame as input for ggplot
```{r}
res <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)
ggplot(res) + aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(res), PC1)) +geom_col() + theme_bw()
```

```{r}
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, hard, and pluribus are in the positive direction. These do make sense based on the correlation structure in the dataset. If you are a fruity candy you will tend to be hard and come in a packet with multiple candies in it.
